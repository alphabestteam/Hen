1.The keyword import means that we get from another file\library the promotion to use her
function and her advantage we will use it when we want to use function like random that all
ready exist but not in our file
2.
3. it used to run blocks just if our program is the main program it is allowed to our program to
run by itself but also friendly to other python programs how may want to import some
functionality without having to run the code
4.in python almost everything is object so with class we can create new kind of objects with
unique attribute
5. the first advantage is that in a big program when you use class instead vairble everything is
more organize and easy to deal with the second thing because we have inheritance and
polymorphism we can create new class it means new objects with similar behaver the third is
classs support synamic dispatch mining the method called on an object is determined at runtime
based on the actual type of the object
6. attribute is one of the main things in opp it means to give to object describe to his action or
what it is like for a car we can tell him to drive that action and we can show his color
7.obgect of class it is object that represent the class it self and can you her methods
8.constructot means a way to build object of any class destructor means that after I build object
form a class I can delete it from the memory
9. the self parameter is reference to the current object and give you the option to access
variables that concted to the class
10.inheritance give us option to make class that contain all the method from anther class but in
them there is anther attribute that make them speshel from other
11.it means many forms we will use it in case we have many object but they look like in the
same name and same behaver but they are different so with polymorphism we can know
exactly what object it is
12 the main different between static and regular function is that with static I donâ€™t need to call
with object I can do this whit the class and we use it when we want to effect all the object that
we make
ENUMS
1. Give you option to names varible to related constants
2. it used to improve code readability and sefety
