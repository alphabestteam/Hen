threading 
    1 threading are way to run our program like i can seprite couple of function to threads and each one of them do just his job
    we need to use them if we want to run couple of function at the same time and we also can control when each of them finish 
    like if i have account and i take mony and at the same time someone give me mony we cant allowed those to function to run at the
    same time the calculation will be wrong
    2 import threading
    3 requests give ass option to send http requests we prefer to use this on socket it is faster 
    5 to prevent conflict beetween threads we can locks one until another finish in quation 1 i give example 
sockets
    1 socket is give us option to connect two programs on differnet network one listen to server and the other connect to the first one
    it used for if we have 2 nodes of different things that we want them to communicate with each other
    no beause socket work whit tcp protocol so some packets can get lost so we can use http or ftp protocol
    2 the socket connect to the server waitng to requests form the client the server has address and the client use it 
    3 af_inet is the address sock_stream is the connection to the tcp protocol
virtual environments
    1 folder that contain all version or lyberyrs that we need to run out program we need it when we have 2 projects with the same modle but
    different versions and we can only use one of the version or when we have a project with  a lot things that download to him and it complicated
    to move the project to different environment 
    2 we open new environment when not matter what we download or deleted or change it happen just there 
    3 first we need to install the viralenv and then we run the command virtualenv venv so far we create folder venv 
    to play it we need to run source./venv/bin/activate 
    4 no beause by defualt i was need to import again some things because the venv dont get tham
