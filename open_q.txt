1. List is a collection of variables which allow to add and remove from the collection after
he declared we can restore many types of variables
Tuples are collection like list but when you declared them you cant add or remove from
them any more but the advantage of them that they are faster then lists
Dictionary is collection that works with the idea key – value you can get variable by the
name of his key they are more comfortable and the search in them is very fast
So if you have data that you don’t going to add or remove from him you need to you
tuples
If you need to use the data and ordered him you list
And if you have a lot of data and you need to search in him you dictionary
2. To add variable to list we use append() method and for remove remove()
method
7. we could use function update({key:value}) or just write new key and it will be add for
example my_list{} and after my_list[“color”] = “red”
And for remove we use pop() method
