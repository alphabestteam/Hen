kubectl scale deployment -n my-namespace backend-deployment --replicas=3


i use this command to increase the pods and this command 

kubectl get pods -n my-namespace

to see them


i should use this when to handle big traffic or where there is workload i also can 
make less of them when the traffic is low

i choose those limitation because i dont have a lot of traffic but if will be a lot of traffic
i will add more it is all depends in the traffic and what i need in the moment
