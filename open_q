1.  no-sql db is a db that not work with tables it is more dinamic but less orginaze 
    we cant do complex things like tables connect to tables and selecting but when we create 
    new collection (it is like tables just in no-sql) it is easy and we can change or update 
    things very fast 
2.  advantages 
            1 very flex schema we dont need to define it before you restore data
            2 it is very good when we have a lot data because we can restor it in many servers
            3 in real time project we can analyze how it works very good 
    disadvantages
            1 because we dont need to define schema before we restore date the data not orgnaize 
            very good and some times we can upload data that has non value 
            2 we cant use select like we use in sql or other mothed that make me new collection
            3 in most things we see sql beasuse it is very old so a lot systems works with sql and 
            not with no-sql
3.  database just as we think database
    collection in database we can have a lot of collection   it is like tables in sql but more flex 
    and we can have more keys
    documents it is in the collection and it is sotred in "bson"
4.  we need id to make every document uniqe and i we dont use it will be very diffiult to accesse to 
    specifice documents
